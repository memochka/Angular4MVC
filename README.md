# Angular4MVC
Since Angular4 is widely used by the client infrastructure for development on the Internet and mobile devices, in this project I created a basic CRUD application (creating, reading, updating and deleting) using the Angular4 Web API and the MVC as the RESTful base API. I created an empty ASP application .NET MVC, configured the Angular4 environment and created a web application with two pages, one for a home page that will have only one image, and the second will be a user management page where the data will be loaded from the SQL Server database and the user will have options for adding a new user, updating and deleting an existing user. For all operations with the database, the RESTful API will be called by the Anguar4, which I developed using the ASP.NET MVC Web API.
I also added a simple data network control by sorting, formatting, and exporting to CSV functions.
